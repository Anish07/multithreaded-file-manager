# Multithreaded File Manager (C++17)

A parallelized file system scanner written in modern C++17.  
It recursively traverses directories, counts files and directories, and sums file sizes using a thread pool of worker threads.  

This project demonstrates **multithreaded programming, synchronization with mutexes and condition variables, and filesystem traversal** â€” core skills for systems and performance engineering.

## Features
- Recursively scans a directory tree
- Counts number of directories, files, and total bytes
- Uses multiple worker threads for concurrency
- Thread-safe task queue with condition variables
- Error handling for inaccessible paths
